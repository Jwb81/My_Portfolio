Self-driven Full-stack Developer with a background in computer science and web development I have been learning and
researching different technologies over the past few years and now I want to put that knowledge to work in order to
create useful web applications that users enjoy working with. I completed the Full-stack Bootcamp through Case Western
where I advanced my skills in Skill 1, Skill 2, and Skill 3. My experience with core web languages, external libraries,
and frameworks as well as my ability to quickly learn help me adapt to any work environment making me an excellent
developer.
